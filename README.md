# robust_adverserial_RL
Pytorch, CleanRL implementation of Robust Adverserial Reinforcement Learning

As described in Pinto, Lerrel, et al. "Robust adversarial reinforcement learning." International Conference on Machine Learning. PMLR, 2017.

Although it doesnt run currently and needs some work, the logic is complete. 

To get this working, 
1.you need to install cleanRL in your environment 
  https://docs.cleanrl.dev/get-started/basic-usage/#two-ways-to-run
2. Download the file rarl_custom_env.py to cleanrl/cleanrl folder
3. Run the command python rarl_custom_env.py
